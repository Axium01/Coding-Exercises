We all know how calculators work: Users enter numbers and perform mathematical operations.

We are going to start with a very simple calculator that will perform a single operation at a time on two or more numbers.

This app will use only prompts and alerts.

Do not use user defined functions for this assignment.  Doing so shall receive a zero for the assignment.

 

1. Prompt the user to enter numbers.

4. When user responds negative to adding more numbers, prompt with operation selection.

(+ for add, - for subtract, * for multiply, / for divide)

Allow only 2 numerals for division.

If division is selected and there are more than 2 numbers, send meaningful error message.

 

5.  Display to user the calculation result along with how many numbers were entered.

6. Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.

If they do want to, loop back to Step 1.
If they do not want to, go to Step 7.

7. When user chooses not to do another calculation, use an alert to present a well considered goodbye message of your choosing,  thanking the user and ending on an upbeat note.

 

For Full Credit:

Proper choice of decision control structure.
User input shall be case insensitive.
All if..else statements use a trailing else. 
UX must be exactly as required above, text, punctuation, spelling, case.  
Exception is where the pictures above show the binary gobbeldeegook along the top.
